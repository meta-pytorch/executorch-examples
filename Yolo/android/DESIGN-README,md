# BirdDetection App: High-Level Flow (YOLO + Android + Species Recognition)

[1] Android Camera Frame
      |
      v
[2] Convert Camera Image (YUV/NV21) --> RGB Bitmap
      |
      v
[3] Preprocess Bitmap for YOLO (resize, normalize)
      |
      v
[4] YOLO Model Inference (ExecuTorch)
      |
      v
[5] YOLO Output: List of Detections
      |    - Each detection: [center_x, center_y, width, height, class scores...]
      |    - For birds: class 14 (COCO) has highest score
      |
      v
[6] Parse YOLO Output
      |    - For each detection:
      |        - If class == bird and confidence > threshold
      |        - Convert [center_x, center_y, width, height] to [left, top, right, bottom]
      |        - Scale coordinates to match actual image size
      |
      v
[7] Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)
      |    - Remove overlapping boxes (keep highest confidence)
      |
      v
[8] For Each Bird Bounding Box:
      |    - Crop region from original Bitmap
      |    - Preprocess crop for classifier (resize, normalize)
      |    - Run Bird Species Classifier (ExecuTorch)
      |    - Get species name and classifier confidence
      |
      v
[9] Display Results in Android UI
      |    - Draw bounding boxes and species labels on overlay
      |    - Log sightings (thumbnail, species, confidence, timestamp)
      |
      v
[10] User Interactions
      |    - Start/End session
      |    - View log of detected birds

## Summary of Each Step

- Camera Frame: Android captures a live image from the camera.
- Image Conversion: Converts raw camera format (YUV/NV21) to RGB Bitmap for ML processing.
- Preprocessing: Resizes and normalizes the bitmap to match YOLO model input requirements.
- YOLO Inference: Runs the YOLO model using ExecuTorch to get object detections.
- YOLO Output: Produces a list of bounding boxes and class scores for each detected object.
- Parsing: Filters detections for birds, converts coordinates, and scales to image size.
- NMS: Removes duplicate/overlapping detections.
- Species Recognition: Crops each bird region, runs a classifier to identify species.
- UI Display: Shows bounding boxes and species names, logs each sighting.
- User Actions: Allows session management and viewing of bird logs.


### Design flow gist

- YOLO finds birds in the camera image.
- Android handles image conversion, UI, and session management.
- The classifier identifies the bird species for each detected bird.
