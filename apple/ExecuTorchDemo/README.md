# ExecuTorch iOS Demo App

This app uses the [MobileNet v3](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/mobilenetv3.html) model to process live camera images leveraging three different backends: [XNNPACK](https://github.com/google/XNNPACK), [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) and [Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders) (Xcode 15+ and iOS 17+ only).

Please refer to the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/executorch/main/demo-apps-ios.html) on how to build and run this app.
